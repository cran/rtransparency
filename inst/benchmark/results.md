# rtransparency accuracy benchmark

Package version 0.9.0. Detectors run on NCBI PMC full-text XML for the
human-labeled held-out test articles of Serghiou et al. (2021), compared to
the published Fig 2 (XML subset). Bootstrap: 2000 resamples, unweighted
(see data-raw/benchmark/README.md). Current values are point [95% CI].
