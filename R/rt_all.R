#' Identify and extract transparency statements from a TXT file.
#'
#' Takes a TXT file and examines whether any statements of Conflicts of Interest
#'     (COI), Funding, Protocol Registration, Novelty or Replication exist. If
#'     any such statements are found, it also extracts the relevant text.
#'
#' @param filename The name of the TXT file as a string.
#' @return A dataframe of results. It returns the PMID of the article (if this
#'     was included in the filename and preceded by "PMID"), whether each of the
#'     five indicators of transparency (COI, Funding, Registration, Novelty and
#'     Replication) was identified, the relevant text identified, and whether
#'     each labelling function identified relevant text or not. The labelling
#'     functions are returned to add flexibility in how this package is used;
#'     for example, future definitions of Registration may differ from the one
#'     we used. If a labelling function returns NA it means that it was not run.
