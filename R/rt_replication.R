#' Identify whether a study includes a replication component in TXT files.
#'
#' Takes a TXT file and returns data related to the presence of a replication
#'     or validation component, including whether such a component exists.

#'     from a prior study in a new sample.

#' @param filename The name of the TXT file as a string.
#' @return A tibble of results. It returns the filename, PMID (if it was part
#'     of the file name), whether a replication component was found, the text
#'     identified, and whether each pattern-matching function identified
#'     relevant text or not.
