# Detect use of a reporting guideline (reporting transparency).
#
# A reporting guideline (the EQUATOR-network checklists: CONSORT for trials,
# PRISMA for systematic reviews, STROBE for observational studies, ARRIVE for
# animal research, and so on) standardizes what a study reports. Whether authors
# state that they followed one, and which, is a TOP-style transparency signal.
#
# Detection is precision-first: a guideline acronym counts only in a reporting
# context (a reporting/adherence verb or a guideline noun such as "statement",
# "checklist" or "guideline"), so a bare citation is not enough. Acronyms that
# are also common English words (CARE, SPIRIT, RECORD, AGREE, ORION) must sit
# directly next to a guideline noun.


# Full spelled-out guideline names. These are unambiguous on their own, so a
# match counts without any extra context. name = canonical acronym.
