#' Identify whether a study claims novelty in TXT files.
#'
#' Takes a TXT file and returns data related to the presence of novelty claims,
#'     including whether a novelty claim exists. If a novelty claim exists, it
#'     extracts the relevant text. Novelty is defined as the study claiming to
#'     report something "for the first time."
#'
#' @param filename The name of the TXT file as a string.
#' @return A tibble of results. It returns the filename, PMID (if it was part
#'     of the file name), whether a novelty claim was found, the text
#'     identified, and whether each pattern-matching function identified
#'     relevant text or not.
